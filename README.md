Adapt Hackathon - proof of concept, when is the shower free

The goal of the project is to create a IoT device, coupled with a online service
that will let out runners know when the shower is occupied.

Each team will have a tiny Arduino controller, a bread board and a bunch
of wires available. The controller has build in wifi and bluetooth so it's
ready to go.
